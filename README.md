# ChimpType

A minimal typing test for terminal written in go.

Born from a desire of having a simple solution to taking a quick typing test break while working on a project from terminal.

The scoring mimics that of [monkeytype.com](https://www.monkeytype.com), where number of characters of correctly written words (including spaces) are summed up and divided by 5 to get the final wpm.
